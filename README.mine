Step-by-Step Deployment Process
This document provides a step-by-step guide to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and deploy the OpenSupports application to development, staging, and production environments on AWS using CloudFormation.

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure the following:

Jenkins is installed and running.
AWS CLI is installed on the Jenkins server and properly configured with credentials.
AWS Access Key and Secret Key are stored in Jenkins as credentials.
CloudFormation templates for deploying EC2, RDS, S3, VPC, and other infrastructure components are ready.
Step 1: Configure Jenkins for CI/CD
1.1 Install Jenkins Plugins
Install the following plugins in Jenkins:

Pipeline Plugin: For running Jenkins pipelines.
Git Plugin: For integrating with GitHub.
AWS CLI Plugin (optional, AWS CLI can also be manually installed on the server).
1.2 Configure AWS Credentials in Jenkins
In Jenkins, navigate to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
Add AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key as credentials.
Kind: AWS Credentials or Secret Text
ID: aws-access-key-id and aws-secret-access-key
Step 2: Create Jenkins Pipeline
2.1 Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job
In Jenkins, click on New Item.
Select Pipeline and name it OpenSupports-CI-CD.
Under the Pipeline section, select Pipeline script from SCM.
Select Git as the SCM and enter your repository URL.
Add any required credentials for accessing the Git repository.
2.2 Create a Jenkinsfile
In the root of your GitHub repository, create a file named Jenkinsfile.
Step 3: Set Up AWS CloudFormation Templates
3.1 Prepare CloudFormation Templates
Make sure you have a CloudFormation template ready for deploying the infrastructure components like EC2 instances, RDS, S3, VPC, and security groups. Store the cloudformation.yaml in your repository.

3.2 Deploy Infrastructure Using CloudFormation
The Jenkins pipeline will automatically deploy the infrastructure using the aws cloudformation deploy command.
Modify the parameters (like Environment, KeyName, and DBPassword) for different environments (development, staging, production) in the CloudFormation template.
Step 4: Trigger the Jenkins Pipeline
After setting up the Jenkinsfile and configuring Jenkins, push the changes to your GitHub repository.
Jenkins will automatically trigger the pipeline and deploy the application to the development environment.
After successful deployment to development, the pipeline will automatically promote the application to staging and finally to production.
Step 5: Monitoring and Testing
Jenkins will run health checks after each deployment (for development, staging, and production) to ensure the application is working as expected.
If any tests fail, the pipeline will stop, and you will need to address the issue before promotion.
Step 6: Promoting the Application
Once the application is successfully tested in the development environment, it will be automatically promoted to the staging environment.
After verifying functionality in staging, the application will be promoted to production.
Step 7: Post-Deployment
If the deployment is successful, Jenkins will display a success message.
If the deployment fails, Jenkins will display an error message, and you can review the logs in Jenkins for more details.
